# 30 Days of Framer Website

## Introduction

This website is an archive for my [30 Days of Framer X](https://hermy0211.github.io/framer30/) project - an experimental project in which I create 30 Framer X prototypes throughout a span of 30 days.

There is a separate [repository](https://github.com/hermy0211/framer30-code) for all of my code. Feel free to download the projects to learn how they're built. All of my work is free to use, as long as it is not used for commercial purposes.

If you have any questions, please contact me at hermy0211@naver.com. Enjoy!
