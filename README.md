# 30 Days of Framer Website

## Introduction

This website is an archive for my [30 Days of Framer](https://hermy0211.github.io/framer30/) project - a project inspired by Tony Jing's ambitious [100 Days of Framer](http://tonyxj.github.io/100daysofframer/). In this project, I create 30 FramerX prototypes throughout a span of 30 days. Checkout the project [here](https://hermy0211.github.io/framer30/)!

There is a separate [repository](https://github.com/hermy0211/framer30-code) for all of my React.js code. Please note that not all of the functionality was built on code alone, and may have use some FramerX features or other design tricks. I am preparing a [Medium](https://medium.com/@annelee_22736) post for every project so you can see how the code and designs fit in together.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at hermy0211@naver.com. Enjoy!
